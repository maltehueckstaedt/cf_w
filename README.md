## Overview

The Chernoff-Faces are a collective of artists, musicians, designers and datascientists. Their productions are mainly limited to the digital space. In order to generate adequate presentation possibilities, the chernoff faces are building their own website. The local repository is used for version control and development of the website. External help is always welcome.
