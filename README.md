## Overview

The Chernoff-Faces are a collective of artists, musicians, designers and datascientists. Their productions are mainly limited to the digital space. In order to generate adequate presentation possibilities, the chernoff faces are building their own website. The local repository is used for version control and development of the website. External help is always welcome.

## Getting help

There are two main places to get help with ggplot2:

1.  The [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is a
    friendly place to ask any questions about ggplot2.

2.  [Stack
    Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&pageSize=50)
    is a great source of answers to common ggplot2 questions. It is also
    a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible
    example that illustrates your problem.
