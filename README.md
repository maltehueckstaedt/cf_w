# chernoff faces - the website <img src="https://github.com/maltehueckstaedt/cf_w/blob/main/images/logo_gif.gif" align="right" width="120" />

## Overview

The Chernoff-Faces are a collective of artists, musicians, designers and datascientists. Their productions are mainly limited to the digital space. In order to generate adequate presentation possibilities, the chernoff faces are building their own website. The local repository is used for version control and development of the website. External help is always welcome.

## Lifecycle

The chernoff faces emerged from the artist collective [local-fist](local-fist.com). For many of the productions of chernoff faces, the work of [Christian Riebe](https://christian-riebe.work) and Marius Albrecht - both also former members of the local-fist - are programmatic.

## Learning ggplot2

If you are new to ggplot2 you are better off starting with a systematic
introduction, rather than trying to learn from reading individual
documentation pages. Currently, there are three good places to start:

1.  The [Data
    Visualisation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) and
    [Graphics for
    communication](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html)
    chapters in [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). R for Data
    Science is designed to give you a comprehensive introduction to the
    [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), and these two chapters will
    get you up to speed with the essentials of ggplot2 as quickly as
    possible.

2.  If you’d like to take an online course, try [Data Visualization in R
    With
    ggplot2](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/data-visualization-in/9781491963661/)
    by Kara Woo.

3.  If you’d like to follow a webinar, try [Plotting Anything with
    ggplot2](https://youtu.be/h29g21z0a68) by Thomas Lin Pedersen.

4.  If you want to dive into making common graphics as quickly as
    possible, I recommend [The R Graphics
    Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org) by Winston Chang. It provides a
    set of recipes to solve common graphics problems.

If you’ve mastered the basics and want to learn more, read [ggplot2:
Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org). It
describes the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2 and shows you how all
the pieces fit together. This book helps you understand the theory that
underpins ggplot2, and will help you create new types of graphics
specifically tailored to your needs.

## Getting help

There are two main places to get help with ggplot2:

1.  The [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is a
    friendly place to ask any questions about ggplot2.

2.  [Stack
    Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&pageSize=50)
    is a great source of answers to common ggplot2 questions. It is also
    a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible
    example that illustrates your problem.
